ldap-forms
==========

creating customs ldap-forms in command line and save in google docs

This is only the base code of the project.

Still have to add python to create a command line tool to create forms (which are very easy to create)

<h3> How to use this forms? </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Rename config-sample.php file in the ldap-forms folder to config.php</li>
  <li> define  $user ,$password,$workSheet,$spreadsheet variables correctly </li>
  <li> $worksheet is normally SheetX (where X is the number) </li>
  <li> $spreadsheet is normally the name of the spread sheet you made in drive (google drive) </li>
</ul>
